# Demo Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the demo GIF that would showcase the PDF Splitter application in action.

## Expected Demo Content

The demo GIF should show:

1. **File Upload**: User dragging a PDF file into the drop zone
2. **Visual Feedback**: Drop zone highlighting during drag operation
3. **File Selection**: PDF file appearing in the interface with file info
4. **Range Input**: User typing page ranges like "1-5,8,10-12"
5. **Live Validation**: Real-time syntax checking and error display
6. **Processing**: Progress bar during PDF splitting
7. **Download**: Automatic ZIP file download
8. **Dark Mode**: Toggling between light and dark themes

## Creating the Demo

To create this demo:

1. Start the application: `make run`
2. Use a sample PDF with 15+ pages
3. Record the screen while performing the workflow
4. Convert to optimized GIF (recommended size: 800px wide, <2MB)
5. Replace this placeholder with `demo.gif`

## Sample Page Ranges for Demo

- `1-5` - First 5 pages
- `1-3,5,7-9` - Complex range with gaps
- `10-15` - Last few pages
- Invalid input: `abc` or `20-30` (for error demo)

The demo should highlight the application's key features:
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Flexible page range syntax
- Real-time validation feedback
- Fast processing and download
- Clean, modern UI with dark mode support
